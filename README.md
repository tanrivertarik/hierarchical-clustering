**Hierarchical Clustering with Dendrogram Visualization**

This Python project demonstrates hierarchical clustering with dendrogram visualization using SciPy and scikit-learn.

**Features:**

- Performs agglomerative hierarchical clustering, merging data points based on similarity.
- Utilizes Ward's minimum variance method for efficient cluster creation.
- Generates a dendrogram to visualize the hierarchical relationships between clusters.

**Requirements:**

- Python (version 3.x recommended)
- SciPy
- scikit-learn

**Installation:**

1. Ensure you have Python installed.
2. Install the required libraries using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install scipy scikit-learn
   ```

**Usage:**

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open a Python terminal or IDE and navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the script `hierarchical_clustering.py` with the path to your data file (CSV, NumPy array, etc.):

   ```bash
   python hierarchical_clustering.py data_path
   ```

   Replace `data_path` with the actual location of your data file.

**Output:**

The script will generate a dendrogram as a plot, visually representing the hierarchical clustering process. By analyzing the dendrogram, you can determine the optimal number of clusters based on the distance between merged clusters.

**Example:**

To perform hierarchical clustering on a file named "data.csv":

```bash
python hierarchical_clustering.py data.csv
```

**Additional Notes:**

- For more advanced customization, refer to the SciPy and scikit-learn documentation:
